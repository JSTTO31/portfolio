                        aspiring
                        full-stack developer with a passion for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. I
                        recently
                        graduated in June 2024 from Arellano University, Jose Rizal Campus. During my internship at
                        Inventive Media, I developed several impactful projects, including an attendance system, the
                        Questify app for mock exams and icebreakers, and the Eventons event management platform. My work
                        reflects a commitment to combining innovative solutions with user-friendly design.</p><br>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;line-height: 40px;" class="text-justify">Additionally, my third-year
                        project,
                        Canteen Kiosk, demonstrated my ability to address real-world challenges by streamlining food
                        ordering processes during the pandemic. In my fourth year, I developed Efficiently, a
                        productivity
                        app, and Arellano Connect, a platform to strengthen alumni connections, which won first
                        runner-up in
                        the Arellano Research Colloquium 2024. I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth, always
                        eager to take on new challenges and enhance my skills in both frontend and backend development.
